        <h2>Types of Bank Accounts</h2>
        <h3>Checking Accounts</h3>
        <p>A checking account is the most basic type of bank account. No interest can be earned on this type of account. 
            The money in the account is inactive unless you choose to transfer, spend, or withdraw it.</p>
        <p>Checing accounts also allow you to use a debit card and checks to directly spend the money in the account without having to withdraw cash. 
            Debit cards are relatively straight forward, only requiring a PIN number chosen by you for use. Checks can look confusing to someone who has never learned how to write one. 
            See the page below to learn how to write a check.</p>
        <h3>Savings Accounts</h3>
        <p>A savings account is a bank account where the money inside earns interest over time. A savings account is a good way to set aside normal spending money. 
            Typically, institutions will allow you to make six withdrawls per month; any withdrawls after that will have an excessive withdrawl fee.</p>
        <h3>Money Market Accounts</h3>
        <p>Money market accounts are not offered by every banking institution. They serve as a hybrid between checking and savings accounts.
            The money within the account earns interest, but also allow you to spend the money within. The interest in these accounts is usually higher than that of a traditional savings account. Typically, you would have a limited number of withdrawls allowed per month (usally six).  </p>
        <h3>Certificates of Deposit</h3>
        <p>A certificate of deposit is a type of bank account which locks in the money you deposit for a specified period of time, typically with a higher interest rate. 
            They are typically refered to as a CD. You should only deposit money you know you will not need to access during the length of the CD. </p>
        <p>While you could take the money in a CD out before the speciifed time period is over, you will likely be charged with an early withdrawl penalty. </p>
