        <h2>Paying for Your Home</h2>
        <p>These costs are typically fixed. They will not vary much if at all.</p>
        <h3>Rent</h3>
        <p>Renting a home is the simplest way to get a place of your own. It can be as easy as an online search and a phonecall. Renting takes place between a rentor and a landlord. 
            Some landlord require an application before they consider renting to you. </p>
        <p>If a landlord is interested in leasing their property they will have you sign a lease agreement and typically place a security deposit of varying costs. 
            The landlord can use this money in many ways, most often to cover the negligence of the leasee.</p>
        <p>After an agreement is reached and the lease agreement is signed, you now have a place of your own. The only catch is that you must abide by all of the rules present in the lease agreement and you must pay the agreed upon amount in rent monthly.</p>
        
        <h3>Mortgage</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a piece of property you will pay a mortgage every month. This mortgage is a loan, which accures interest over time. 
            This means that you will end up paying more than your initial loan amount. That's how banks make their money from loans.</p>
        <p>Once your mortgage is paid off, you will no longer need to pay for your home, other than insurance and taxes.</p>
