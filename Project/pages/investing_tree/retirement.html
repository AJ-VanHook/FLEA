        <h2>Why Retirement Plans are Important</h2>
        <p>The most effective way to become wealthy is to invest a small amount of money over your full lifetime. By the time you are able to retire, you will be  so comfortably. According to Money Magazine, 55% of Americans don't have investments into an IRA or 401(k) account.</p>
        <h2>What Main Types of Plans are Available?</h2>
        <h3>IRAs</h3>
        <p>IRAs (individual retirement arrangements) are tax deductible retirement plans which individuals can contribute to with earned income. 
            A traditional IRA is taxed when money is withdrawn, while a Roth IRA is contributed with after-tax dollars, meaning they will be not taxed upon withdrawl.</p>
        <h3>401(k)s</h3>
        <p>The 401(k) is a plan that allows employees of corporations to make contributions with their earned income. A traditional 401(k) is taxed when money is withdrawn, while a Roth 401(k) is contributed with after-tax dollars, meaning they will be not taxed upon withdrawl.</p>
        <h3>Others</h3>
        <p>403(b)s are retirement plans offered mainly by non-profits and public schools. They are very similar to 401(k)s.</p>
        <p>457s are retirement plans for state and local government employees.</p>
