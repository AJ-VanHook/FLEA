        <h2>Saving as a Tool</h2>
        <p>Realistically, there is only one consistent method of becoming wealthy: saving. If you are not saving, you are not wealth-building. Even if you are not trying to build your fortune, saving will help you make big purchases, pay-off already existing debt, and give you peace of mind.</p>
        <p>There are two very important tools for saving: goal-setting and budgeting</p>
