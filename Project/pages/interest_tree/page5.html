        <h2>What is Interest</h2>
        <p>Interest is what you owe for borrrowing money. Interest rates are determined by the Federal Reserve. Basically, interest is what those who loan you money earn by incurring risk when they loan you money.</p>
        <p>For example, if you want to purchase a home for $250,000, but do not have that amount of money, you will need to take out a loan from a bank. Whatever this loan amount is for, you will end up paying back more when you pay off your loan. This is because you pay interest on the capital you initially borrowed.</p>
        <h2>The Two Main Types of Interest</h2>
        <h3>Simple Interest</h3>
        <p>This type of interest is a set rate on the initial amount borrowed. This is the type of interest you want to take on when you take a loan.</p>
        <h3>Compounding Interest</h3>
        <p>This type of interest is a set rate on the initial amount borrowed and any accured interest. This would be the type of interest you want to use to become wealthy.</p>
