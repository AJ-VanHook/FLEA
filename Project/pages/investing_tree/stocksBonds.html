        <h2>Stocks</h2>
        <p>Trading stocks is a very risky investment strategy. You are basically buying a small piece of ownership in a company, which can appreciate or depreciate in value over time.
            You are also subject to recieve dividends, where the company pays out profits to you.
        </p>
        <h2>Mutual Funds</h2>
        <p>Mutual funds are a diversified group of investments, usually managed by someone at an investment company. These types of invesments are usually safer and less risky than individual investments.</p>
        <h2>Bonds</h2>
        <p>Bonds are a type of investment strategy where a bond issuer, like the government or a compnay, owes you money for purchasing the bond. They pay you interest on the bond until it matures or you sell the bond to someone else.
            Some bonds have fixed interest rates, others have rates that can change. If the interest rate becomes more favorable, others may be interested in purchasing the bond from you for more than you paid for it.
