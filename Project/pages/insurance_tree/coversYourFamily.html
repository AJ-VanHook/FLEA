        <h3>Life Insurancce</h3>
        <p>Life insurance is an insurance that replaces income due to death. Dave Ramsey suggestes that you should have a life insurance that pays out at about 10 times your income.</p>
        <h3>Burial Insurance</h3>
        <p>Burial insurance helps pay for your funeral and burial in the event of your death. This is more common for those of an older age.</p>
        <h3>Pet Insurance</h3>
        <p>Pet insurance helps pay for accidents that cause your pet injury or illnesses that afflict your pet. They typically do not cover wellness services, like vaccines, or elective operations, like spaying or neutering.</p>
