        <h2>Certificates of Deposit (CDs)</h2>
        <p>A certificate of deposit is a type of bank account which locks in the money you deposit for a specified period of time, typically with a higher interest rate. 
            They are typically refered to as a CD. You should only deposit money you know you will not need to access during the length of the CD. </p>
        <p>While you could take the money in a CD out before the speciifed time period is over, you will likely be charged with an early withdrawl penalty. </p>
        <h2>Money Market Accounts</h2>
        <p>Money market accounts are not offered by every banking institution. They serve as a hybrid between checking and savings accounts.
            The money within the account earns interest, but also allow you to spend the money within. The interest in these accounts is usually higher than that of a traditional savings account. Typically, you would have a limited number of withdrawls allowed per month (usally six).  </p>
        <h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency is a relatively new type of invesment, which is extremely risky for investors. The high volatility in cryptocurrency results from the completely speculative nature that investors in cryptocurrency have.
            This type of investing is also very susceptible to scamming. There are few regulations on cryptocurrency trading due to its relatively recent creation, so the best way to stay safe is to stay away.
        </p>
        <h2>Real Estate</h2>
        <p>Because property rarely drops in value significantly, it is generally considered a pretty safe investment, but you should be sure to have lots of cash before making this type of invesment.
            This is beacuse you cannot just withdraw the money you have invested into a piece of property; you would have to find a buyer and sell the property.
