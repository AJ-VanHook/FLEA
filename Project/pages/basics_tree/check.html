        <h2>Writing a Check</h2>
        <h3>Where to Acquire Checks</h3>
        <p>When you open a bank account, you are usually given a set of checks with your initial paperwork. After you use those, you could get get checks from the bank or order a set of checks from your institution.</p>
        <h3>Information on Your Check</h3>
        <p>In the bottom left corner of your check, you will be able to see your routing number, account number, and check number. Your check number can also be found at the top right of your check. Your personal information should be visible in the top left of the check.</p>
        <h3>What you Need to Fill Out</h3>
        <p>The date, visible in the top right corner of the check.</p>
        <p>The payee information, whether they be an individual or a business. Visible in the middle of the check, says "PAY TO THE ORDER OF".</p>
        <p>The amount you are writing the check for in two locations, first written out below the payee information using everyday language (i.e. "Fifteen Dollars and 00/100" for a $15 payment) and then using numerical values inside of a box with the dollar sign symbol.</p>
        <p>The memo line, optionally. The information there is to provide clarity as to the purpose of payment.</p>
        <p>Your signature, in the bottom right of the check, making this check leagally binding. You are creating an agreement that you will pay the payee and have those funds available.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-area">
        <h2>What Can Go Wrong?</h2>
        <h3>Bouncing a Check</h3>
        <p>If you write a check for an amount you do not have, your check will bounce. You will be charged a fee by your bank and the payee who deposited the check may also be charged a fee.</p>
        <h3>The Check is Lost</h3>
        <p>If you write a check and it is lost before it can be deposited or you are worried someone has stolen the check, you can contact your bank to issue a stop payment. This would incur a fee, but will ensure you that the funds written on the check will not be removed from your account.</p>
        <h3>You Make a Mistake on the Check</h3>
        <p>Simply write out "VOID" in bold lettering across the entirety of the check.</p>
